									<section>
										
										<p>The dedicated form of approach I want to use here is the construction of a full Pro Forma document that encompasses the entirety of the business structure, from Retail, Wholesale, Processing, Transporation, Management, Executives, our Cost of Goods, Sales Forecasting, and more. This process will take roughly one week with one or two meetings to establish all details and variables with Green Soul, LLC. I know I've shown an example to you, Abe, but I didn't screenshare with Waleed the details as well. I would be happy to cover this in person.</p>
										<p>Once the structure is dedicated, and our plan for growth is well understood, the first method of approach is to begin the process for the B2C outlet (i.e. dispensaries). I know we spoke about this in some detail, regarding a desire to keep it within Oklahoma City as the beginning, somewhat considering Nichols Hills, and removing consideration for the South Side of Oklahoma City.</p>
										<p>Outside of the Pro Forma, a zip code analysis and market research can be performed as well, detailing the regional realities (but not limited to), average rent, landlord availability, zip code based income, marketing observations and potentials, customer demographics, product demographics, and more.</p>
										<p>Other methods of approach ramp up as we begin this process, please feel free to throw any questions my way!</p>
