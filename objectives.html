						<h1 class="major">Strategic Goals & Objectives</h1>
						<p>I have spent quite a bit of time speaking about my specific experience and skills in the marketplace, and my goal is to detail our strategic goals and objectives in this as a living document. For all entities - establishing the best cost of goods for our products is key - keeping up with market realities and understanding the true cost of a good, (raw+labor+packaging+test+marketing+sale+ship) is necessary to dominate sales for every entity, retail or wholesale. I have spoken at length about the direct power that a connection to the consumer is, and where the brand strength lies in Oklahoma (the retailers). See below for a PDF to a basic breakdown of cost efficiency. </p><ul class="actions">
							<li><a href="cog.pdf" target="new" class="button">Cost of Goods Overview</a></li>
						</ul>
						<p>That's a limited definition of how to achieve the most efficient/highest value within the entities. On to the pragmatics:</p>
						<p><a href="vsa.pdf" target="new" class="button">Vertical Strategy / Approach</a></li></p>
						<p>The creation of a vertical structure comes full circle with our ability to effectively sell products B2C. Knowing this is our growth model for true success, our methodology in achieving this is simple: doing it as fast as possible. This includes the use of wholesale bootstrapping (i.e. sales/fundraising) to reach our goalposts as quickly as possible. Ultimately, a structure of 8+ dispensaries in Oklahoma is all that would be required to maintain consumer profile to dominate the state.</p>
						<p>Our primary objectives are listed in the deliverables of this web document, but for specific mention, I am including some of the baseline objectives we must accomplish for strategic success.
							<ul>
								<li>Retail Locations & Licensing</li>
								<li>Processing License / Location</li>
								<li>Transporation License / Location</li>
								<li>Reputation Management, Digital Marketing, Marketplace Development</li>
							</ul></p>
							<p>Considering the cultivation of Green Soul LLC has been in process for years, even surviving the winter storm from two years ago (that was quite the ordeal), we have a firm backbone to begin on, with very experienced operators as the helm.</p>
							<p>Knowing you are currently using an agency for digital marketing purposes, my goal would be to work with that, as well as audit those processes internally to make sure they output as maximum efficiency.</p>
