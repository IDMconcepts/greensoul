								<h3>The Problems</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>Most problems experienced in the current cannabis market today serve as strengths to those with the abilities and conviction to meet the challenges as they come, even more so to those who anticipate those problems. Market problems include <b>Predatory Marketing</b>, specifically as companies mislead operators, and poorly educate patients and consumers. <b>Price</b> continues on a downtrend as more and more operators continue to treat these products purely as a commodity, destroying the nature of value. <b>Staff</b>, rather, the lack of, or poorly trained staff, dominates the market, where our front line employees tend to have fewer abilities than the average fast food worker or server, and are asked to deliver "top-notch" sales, be it in the wholesale or retail market.</b></span></p>
								<h3 align="right">The Solutions</h3>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>Luckily, knowing the problems gives us the power to provide solutions. Knowledge is power, and creating client relationships is easily fixed with additional care and training. Every solution comes down to an approach utilizing human resources as the key component to success - we are only as strong as the weakest link. Price is a description of <b>value</b>, and a great offer is simply one that one would feel stupid to <b>not take</b>. Offering the highest level of service doesn't just come down to the THC %, as we know, and the better we reflect upon our consumers, B2B and B2C, the higher our pricing ability becomes. <b>Staffing</b> is as simple as good management, and good management is easily defined: effective communication. Having clear goals, paths upwards, positive attitudes, which sound very simple in theory, and are also very simple in application. We have discussed consistently that the primary thing that has been lacking in the Green Soul, LLC. growth model is the <b>team itself</b>.</p>
